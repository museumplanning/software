Historic WPA mural = preservation mandate. Project built and opened 2020. COVID + new mayor (Sandra Vincent) closed it calling it 'racist' vanity project. Election pressure forced reopening 2024, Mark got it operational in days. Mayor lost reelection, museum closed again. BUT: Success of reopening inspired Mayor Vincent to commission citywide Cultural Plan 2026-2031 ($35K fee, worth $100K+). Museum project expanded to citywide cultural infrastructure planning.

Project had EXCELLENT methodology (7 personas, empathy maps, journey maps, service blueprints, evaluation framework) but wrong decision maker doomed it from start. Budget was realistic ($1M over 6 years, appropriately phased) - problem was not budget but lack of funding commitment and wrong authority structure.

Proposal March 2024: $156K \u2192 $110K with discount, $200/hour rate. Museum concept: Baobab tree entrance (Tree of Life), 7 continents layout, interactive exhibits, STEM activities, school field trips. CLIENT REFUSED CURRICULUM INTEGRATION - instant dealbreaker. SUSPECTED ILLEGAL/ENDANGERED SPECIMENS in 10,000 piece collection = massive legal liability. Family board structure = likely tax shelter scheme. Museums 101 sent but not acknowledged. PROJECT DECLINED despite adequate budget ($110K) because: (1) Legal liability from suspected illegal specimens, (2) Client refused mandatory school curriculum integration requirement, (3) Family board indicates tax shelter not genuine museum, (4) Professional/ethical integrity conflict. LESSON: Private taxidermy collections + family boards + curriculum refusal = DECLINE IMMEDIATELY regardless of budget. V3 file indicates multiple proposal revisions before final decline. Perfect example of ethical screening - some projects are not worth the risk at any price."
